# I'm a MERN-Stack Developer

## Status

My name is Milad Mosadegh. I am a full stack web developer with a degree from DCI (Digital Career Institute).
I love coding and it is my favorite job that I do every day. I am open to learn every day and try to make this world better and better. 

Now I am working in DCI (Digital Career Institute) as an AT. I hope the world is big enough to give me what I want.

I am happy that you are reading my status. It means a lot to me.
